      the basilisk and the two of them can see each other, the basilisk can force
      the creature to make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw if the basilisk isn''t

      and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn.
      On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until
      freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic. A creature that isn''t
      surprised can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn.
      If it does so, it can''t see the basilisk until the start of its next turn,
      when it can avert its eyes again. If it looks at the basilisk in the meantime,
      it must immediately make the save. If the basilisk sees its reflection within

      the creature, which falls prone in a space within 10 feet of the behir. If the

      <b>Eye Rays.</b> The beholder shoots three of the following magical eye rays
      at random (reroll duplicates), choosing one to three targets it can see within
      120 feet of it:


      <b>1. Charm Ray.</b> The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving
      throw or be charmed by the beholder for 1 hour, or until the beholder harms

      at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.


      <b>4. Slowing Ray.</b> The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity
      saving throw. On a failed save, the target''s speed is halved for 1 minute.
      In addition, the creature can''t take reactions, and it can take either an action
      or a bonus action on its turn, not both. The creature can repeat the saving
      throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect 0n itself on a success.

      <b>6. Telekinetic Ray.</b> If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a
      DC 16 Strength saving throw or the beholder moves it up to 30 feet in any direction.
      It is restrained by the ray''s telekinetic grip until the start of the beholder''s
      next turn or until the beholder is incapacitated. If the target is an object
      weighing 300 pounds or less that isn''t being worn or carried, it is moved up
      to 30 feet in any direction. The beholder can also exert fine control on objects
      with this ray, such as manipulating a simple tool or opening a door or a container.


      <b>7. Sleep Ray.</b> The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving
      throw or fall asleep and remain unconscious for 1 minute. The target awakens
      if it takes damage or another creature takes an action to wake it. This ray
      has no effect on constructs and undead.


      <b>8. Petrification Ray.</b> The targeted creature must make a DC 16 Dexterity
      saving throw. On a failed save, the creature begins to turn to stone and is
      restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On
      a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed
      by the greater restoration spell or other magic.


      <b>9. Disintegration Ray.</b> If the target is a creature, it must succeed on
      a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 45 (10d8) force damage. If this damage
      reduces the creature to 0 hit points, its body becomes a pile of fine grey dust.
      If the target is a Large or smaller non magical object or creation of magical
      force, it is disintegrated without a saving throw. If the target is a Huge or
      larger object or creation of magical force, this ray disintegrates a 10-foot
      cube of it.

      bright light, the duplicates disappear. Whenever any creature targets the cloaker
      with an attack or a harmful spell while a duplicate remains, that creature rolls
      randomly to determine whether it targets the cloaker or one of the duplicates.
      A creature is unaffected by this magical effect if it can't see or if it relies
      on senses other than sight. A duplicate has the cloaker's AC and uses its saving
      throws. If an attack hits a duplicate, or if a duplicate fails a saving throw
      against an effect that deals damage, the duplicate disappears."
